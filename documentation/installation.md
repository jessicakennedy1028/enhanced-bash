# Installation
Over all, wether you decide to install this with the install script, or manually, the process is rather easy. You do not need to install everything for most of the items to work. For example, some packages that the install script will add are:

jq: this is a json package that allows JSON to be used within BASH scripts. If you do not install this package, you will not see any differences in this current version of Enhanced BASH. This was added for the next version which will be using JSON from 3rd party web applications to bring in data.

git: this is a git repository utility to clone and push scripts from github, gitlab, or other repository sites. This is used for the update script. You can ignore this if you do not want to manually update this application.
